Variables and Data Types Exercise

1.  
	a.)  let name = 'Matthew Joki Jul 23';
	b.)  let dayOfBirth = 7;

2.  If more than one variable is declared with the same name, the last variable declared will take precedence.

3.  let color = prompt('Enter your favorite color');
    console.log(color);

4.  let str = "This string\'s text contains \'\' inside double quotes";

5.  The difference between null and undefined is that null is just an empty placeholder indicating that a value could go there, and it is intentially left absent, and undefined is a value that is the unintentional absence of a value, like when a variable is declared but not initiated.

6.  In JavaScript, NaN is returned when the compiler cannot complete an expression due to non-existant values, such as the result given of undefined for 1/0.  Nan is returned because numbers cannot be divided by 0, as an example.

7.  If a variable:  let thing; is declared, it will have a value of undefined.
