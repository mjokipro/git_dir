## Review

- Give context
- Set up the problem
- Write what you did to solve it and WHY

- Anything is fair game on resume
	- AWS - less comfortable, but you have experience
	- I have used it, could learn more about aws
- Joel:
	- very few ppl understand careers beyond their own
	- how do you connect about what you used to do to software engineering
		- teaching other teachers - how to lead a team. How to best support your teach to improve on what they’re doing
		- realistic expectations of what they should be doing. Working your way up slowly
		- practice what this is for you
	- Some people:
		- web development = html css, not software 

## Goals

-   Understand what a take home challenge is
-   Learn how to excel at take-homes
-   Figure out when and when not to do a take-home

## Take Home Challenges
possible that you might get this before the phone screen.
if so, likely non-technical person reviewing it. Make sure your read me says exactly how to run the app, and includes screenshot
– often times there is a time associated with the take home challenge, may not be in your best interest to spend 30 hours on a 4 hour challenge.
– people are worried about writing code for free, but most often this is not what’s happening

- & Follow instructions
	- build a small react app that has these 3 things
	- measuring how closely you can follow a spec
- Write good documentation
    - Write incredibly detailed README
        - Include screen shots of main parts of app
            - they may not even run the app necessarily
- Write tests
    - Show them in the README exactly how to run them
- Be mindful of code cleanliness
    - Curb-appeal
    - “Would we want this in our production code?”

## Tips and Tricks

-   Keep your previous work organized
    -   So you can remember how to set up React/testing/etc
-   Get comfortable with [Markdown at GitHub](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
-   Run your tests!
-   Discuss your work positively in your email to them
	- even if you didn’t finish, talk about what you learned, talk about the interesting part of it. At a high level, review what you would have done to add this feature. 
	- here’s what we did, here’s what the next step would be, etc.

### How to practice

- Build small apps or redo exercises!
- Find small challenges on GitHub
- Work on as a pair or team
    - You can learn more tips and get feedback from others
- Above all: **keep building**

## When to take homes and when not to

- Should you do every challenge?
	- maybe
	- Have you done a phone screen?
		- Then yes - absolutely
	- Is it an automatic email?
		- maybe, but way less priority, and mostly for practice
- Early on in job search
	- getting going, won’t have many challenges
	- So, then absolutely do it
- You can always tell them
	- I’m in the middle of another challenge, can you send it to me on Thursday
	- If you’ve have phone screen, then absolutely do it
	- If you have multiple challenges, then can prioritize
		- every bit of code you write helps you
		- this can be frustrating
		- but come with the framing that these are helpful challenges that help you
	- There are companies that are hiring in languages you don’t know
		- Ruby? less popular, but there are still jobs out there
		- Should you do a code challenge in a language you don’t know?
			- less priority, unless company has reassured that it’s okay
			- Weigh this a bit - angular vue, popular, but not really taught by bootcamps
	- FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
		- do exactly what they’re asking for
			- even if you know a better way
		- use an array to insert items at the beginning of an array
			- do the challenge as asked
			- write tests
			- don’t do anything else not asked
