    -   Checking technical boxes
-   Learning about the kind of engineer you are

	- you are way more than 17 weeks of js
	- managed ppl in stressful scenarios
	- dealt with technical aspects in first job

### What happens when I know the answer?

- Take a deep breath
	- Organize your thoughts: “That’s a really interesting question”
- Start talking
- & Pause when you can and check in to avoid rambling
  interviewers like you the more they get to talk
    -   Would you like to know about a time I did/used X?
    -   Anything else I can clarify here?

be much more deferential, thank you name, that was a great question
make it seem like a fellow conversation with another engineer.
let them speak, be sure to ask them questions

### What happens when I don’t know the answer?

- Take a deep breath
- Feel free to ask “May I take a minute to think about it?”
	- that’s an interesting one
- Don’t go silent
	- without giving a heads up
- Be honest and say you don’t know!
    - confident curious don’t know: “i’ve never worked with that, we did work with X, would you like me to tell you about that?“
    - Think of something you might have done with this idea/concept
    - Ask clarifying questions to steer you toward a good answer
        - I don’t know what the furrby framework does, could you tell me about it for a minute so I can see if it relates to something I have done?

### How to discuss professional projects

- Internship as part of the coding school
- Experience on professional codebase
- Learned new technologies (have a list of a few)
	- had to learn about these new technologies independently 
- Encountered real-world engineering problems
    - Team work, Git issues, PRs, story-pointing
    - storypointing, merge conflicts, git issues, retros
- Make sure you have a good understanding of the technology you used  
    and why you engineered certain things a certain way
	- what was good/bad about the technologies you worked with
		- why did you 
		- we looked around the codebase and found some code that used this…. but then decided against that because
		- the why - is a very engineery conversation
		- this is what I like about X framework, and it’s different from React in X ways, and this way is really cool, but I really miss Y from React
