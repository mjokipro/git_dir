- API stands for Application Programming Interface
- APIs are mechanisms that allow two software components to communicate with one another using a set of protocols

There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.

### SOAP APIs 

These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.

### RPC APIs

These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.

### Websocket APIs

[Websocket API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-overview?pg=wianapi&cta=websocketapi) is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.

### REST APIs

These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client.
