## Front end

- Better at *highly dynamic* apps
	- e.g. Google maps - can click and drag to move around and loads that section of the map
	  (if this was built using back end, clicking an arrow would move over 1inch and reload the page)

## Back end

- Better for page-by-page experiences
	- Keeps things cohesive and organized when built on the back-end
	- e.g. rithmâ€™s site - navigating to lectures, exercises, etc. is very page by page with that info
