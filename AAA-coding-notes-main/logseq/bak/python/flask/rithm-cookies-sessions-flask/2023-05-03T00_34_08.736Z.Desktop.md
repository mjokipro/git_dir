## Goals
-   Define what it means for HTTP to be stateless
-   Compare different strategies for persisting state across requests
-   Explain what a cookie is, and how  
    client-server cookie communication works
-   Compare cookies and sessions
-   Implement session functionality with Flask

## Motivation: Saving State
- HTTP is what’s called a “stateless” protocol.
- On its own, it remembers nothing.
	- It’s like a goldfish. Every time it circles around, what it sees is brand new.

### Some ways to save state
-   GET request: Passing info in a query param / POST form:  hidden field
    -   `/step-zero?fav-color=blue` → `/step-one?fav-color=blue` →  ...
-   Keeping info in URL path
    -   `/fav-color/blue/step-zero` → `/fav-color/blue/step-one` → …
-   Using JS [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
    -   Nice, but *only JS* can access this — you can’t get data on server
    -   Useful for single-page applications or heavily AJAX-driven apps
-   Using cookies / sessions

## Cookies

- Flask’s session is powered by cookies; let’s start there

### Cookies Save “State”

Cookies are a way to store small bits of info on client (browser)

### What is a Cookie?

- Cookies are **name/string-value pair** stored by the **client** (browser).
- & The **server** tells client to store these, the cookie lives in the **client’s browser** 
- & Cookie is always a **string** (both key and value are **strings**)
- The client sends cookies to the server with each request.

<table><colgroup><col width="35%"> <col width="33%"> <col width="31%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Site</td><td>Cookie Name</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>rithmschool.com</td><td>number_visits</td><td>“10”</td></tr><tr><td>rithmschool.com</td><td>customer_type</td><td>“Enterprise”</td></tr><tr><td>localhost:5000</td><td>favorite_food</td><td>“taco”</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Cookies, A Conversation

-   _Browser_: I’d like to get the resource /upcoming-events.
-   _Server_: Here’s some HTML. Also, please remember this piece of information: favorite\_food is `"taco"`.
-   _Browser_ (stores this somewhere on the computer- up to browser how and where to store) 
-   _Browser_: I’d like to get the resource /event-detail. Also, you told me to remind you that favorite\_food is `"taco"`.
-   _Server_: Here’s the HTML for that.
-   _Browser_: I’d like to get the resource /calendar.jpg. Also, you told me to remind you that favorite\_food is `"taco"`
-   …

### Seeing Cookies in Chrome

Dev Tools → Application → Storage → Cookies

### Settings Cookies in Flask

demo/app.py
```python
# would also need:
# 

@app.get('/handle-form-cookie')
def handle_form():
    """Return form response; include cookie for browser."""

    fav_color = request.args['fav_color']

    # Get HTML to send back. Normally, we'd return this, but
    # we need to do in pieces, so we can add a cookie first
    html = render_template("response-cookie.html", fav_color=fav_color)

    # In order to set a cookie from Flask, we need to deal
    # with the response a bit more directly than usual.
    # First, let's make a response obj from that HTML
    resp = make_response(html)

    # Let's add a cookie to our response. (There are lots of
    # other options here--see the Flask docs for how to set
    # cookie expiration, domain it should apply to, or path)
    resp.set_cookie('fav_color', fav_color)

    return resp

```

### Reading Cookies in Flask

demo/app.py

```
@app.get('/later-cookie')
def later():
    """An example page that can use that cookie."""

    fav_color = request.cookies.get('fav_color', '<unset>')

    return render_template("later-cookie.html", fav_color=fav_color)

```

### Cookie Options

-   **Expiration**: how long should the browser remember this?
    -   Can be set to a time; default is “as long as web browser is running” _(session cookie)_
-   **Domain**: which domains should this cookie be sent to?
    -   Send only to books.site.com or everything at site.com?
-   **HttpOnly** - HTTP-only cookies aren’t accessible via any kind of JavaScript
    -   Useful for cookies that contain server-side information and don’t need to be available to JavaScript.

    
| Site | Cookie | Expiration | Domain | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| www.rithmschool.com | num\_visits | (browser) | \*.rithmschool.com | “10” |
| shop.rithmschool.com | cus\_type | 2015-12-31 | shop.rithmschool.com | “Enterprise” |
| localhost:5000 | fav\_color | (browser) | localhost:5000 | “blue” |

### Comparison of Types of Browser Storage

-   LocalStorage
    -   Doesn’t have expiration date; only through JS or clearing browser cache
    -   Domain specific
    -   Storage limit is much larger than a cookie
-   SessionStorage
    -   Stores data only until browser window/tab is closed
    -   Storage limit is much larger than a cookie
-   Cookie
    -   Sent from browser to server for _every request_ to the domain
    -   Set _(usually)_ from server; can be read by browser or server
        -   Can prevent JS from accessing by setting httpOnly flag on cookie

### A Visual Display

- LocalStorage default now 10MB

## Sessions

### Cookies Can Be Tricky

-   Cookies are just strings
-   Cookies are limited by how much information you can store
-   Cookies are a bit low-level in how you use them

### Sessions

Flask sessions are a “magic dictionary”

![_images/magic-dict.jpg|250](https://rithm-students-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/r30/lectures/flask-session/handout/_images/magic-dict.jpg)

-   Contain info for the current browser
-   Preserve type (lists stay lists, etc)
-   Are _signed_, so users can’t modify data

### Using Session in Flask

-   Import session from flask
-   Set a secret\_key

```
from flask import Flask, session

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "SHHHHHHHHHHH SEEKRIT"
```

Now, in routes, you can treat session as a dictionary:
```
@app.get('/some-route')
def some_route():
    """Set fav_number in session."""

    session['fav_number'] = 42
    return "Ok, I put that in the session."
```

To get things out, treat it like a dictionary:

```
from flask import session

@app.get('/my-route')
def my_route():
    """Return information using fav_number from session."""

    return f"Favorite number is {session['fav_number']}"
```

It will stay the same kind of data (in this example, an integer)

You also have direct access to session automatically in Jinja templates:

```
Your favorite number is {{ session['fav_number'] }}
```

### How Do Sessions Work?

-   Different web frameworks handle this differently
-   In Flask, the sessions are stored in the browser as a cookie
    -   `session = "eyJjYXJ0IjLDIsMiwyLDJdfQ.CP0ryA2EMSZdE"`
    -   They’re _serialized_ and _signed_
    -   So users could see, but can’t change their actual session data—only Flask can

_Advanced details:_ Flask by default uses the Werkzeug provided “secure cookie” as session system. It works by serializing the session data, compressing it and base64 encoding it.

Are “Sessions” Related to “Session Cookies”?

Not directly, no.

They both just use the term “session” but to mean something different.

By default: Flask sessions use browser-lifetime cookies (“session cookies”). So a Flask session lasts as long as your browser window.

Yes, you can change that (read the Flask docs!)

This distinction isn’t too important right now, but the terminology sometimes comes up in interviews, so be sure to review this material!

Note

Server-Side Sessions

Some web frameworks store session data on the server instead.

> -   Often, in a relational database
> -   Sends a cookie with _session key_, which tells server how to get the real data
> -   Useful when you have lots of session data, or for complex setups
> -   Flask can do this with the add-on [Flask-Session](http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Session/)

### Updating a Session

- When updating session data, it is the reassignment of the session in flask that triggers the “send cookie” behavior. 
	- If you were to mutate a value on a session, this would not trigger a new cookie to update the session on the client’s side, because no reassignment happened.
- Thus, need to:
	- 1. Create new variable with the value from the session
	- 2. Mutate the variable
	- 3. Reassign the session at that key to the updated variable
```python
responses = session[KEY]    
responses.append(variable) 
session[KEY] = responses    # This reassignment triggers the "send updated cookie" in flask

```

### Which Should I Use? Cookies or Sessions?

Generally, sessions.

It’s important to know how cookies work, but if your framework provides sessions (as Flask does), they’re easier to work with.
