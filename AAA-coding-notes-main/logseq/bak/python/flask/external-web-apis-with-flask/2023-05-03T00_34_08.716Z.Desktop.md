## API Requests

- Two ways to *talk with APIs*:
	-   Client-side requests (via AJAX) 
		- no refresh
	-   Server-side requests
		- from flask app
- (Note: doesn’t apply to all requests - just when you talk with APIs)
- If your app *accepts JSON* and *returns JSON* = It’s an API

### Why Use Client-Side Requests?

![[external-web-apis-with-flask-1679085632722.jpeg]]

-   You can do so easily using AJAX libraries
-   Don’t have to involve Flask in the API
-   Can be faster: browser could talk directly to, say, Google Maps

### Why Use Server-Side Requests?

![[external-web-apis-with-flask-1679085650490.jpeg]]

-   Same-Origin Policy may prevent browser requests
-   Easier for server to store/process the data
    -   eg have Flask request restaurants and store in database
-   Need password to access API
    -   If API uses password & we make request in browser JS, people could learn password from reading JS
    - Therefore, server-side is more secure in this way
- % Note: Insomnia is great for web requests API in a vacuum - *not* good for server-side requests

## iTunes API

refresher on making an api request using curl:
```shell
$ curl -i
>  'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=billy+bragg&limit=3'
{
 "resultCount":5,
 "results": [
  {"wrapperType":"track", "kind":"song", "artistId":"163251",
 ...
```
- Returns JSON response

## Python Requests

```
(venv) $ pip3 install requests
```

### GET Requests w/ Python

- Syntax:
```python
requests.get(url, params)
```

- Example:
```python
import requests

resp = requests.get(
    "https://itunes.apple.com/search",
    params={"term": "billy bragg", "limit": 3}
)

print(resp.json())
```

### POST Requests w/ Python

- Syntax:
```python
requests.post(url, data, json)
```

- *data*
	- Dictionary of data to send in traditional web form format
- *json*
	- Dictionary of data to send as a JSON string
- Most modern APIs expect to receive JSON, not traditional web form format.

### Setting HTTP Headers 

- Authorization is a standard header for Oauth
- Setting up an Authorization header in a post request:
```python
token = "some-string..."
requests.post(
    "http://some-api.com/searchWithAuth",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}  
)
```
- & Read API docs to know if/what data is needed in ‘headers’ key.

### Responses

- Both `.get()` and `.post()` return a Response instance
- `.text`
	- Text of response
- `.status_code`
	- Numeric status code (200, 404, etc)
- `.json()`
	- Convert JSON response text to Python dictionary

[giphy api example:](external-web-apis-with-flask-1679086645019.jpeg)
```python
@app.get('/search-giphy') 
def search_giphy():
	"""
	Handle form submission, make request to Giphy API with 'term' value from query string.
	Return form, showing giphy image.
	"""

	term = request.args['term']

	response = requests.get(
		GIPHY_BASE_URL,
		params={
			"api_key": GIPHY_KEY,  # names of these keys expected are in giphy API docs
			"q": term   # Need to read the docs to know what to send
		}
	)

	r = response.json()
	... etc.
```

mapquest example:
```python
def request_coords(location):
	"""Return {lat,lng} from MapQuest for given location."""
	
	response = requests.get(
		f"{API_BASE_URL}/address",
		params={
			"key": MAPQUEST_KEY,
			"location": location
		}
	)
	r = response.json()
	
	lat = r['results'][0]['locations'][0]['latLng']['lat']
	lng = r['results'][0]['locations'][0]['latLng']['lng']
	
	return {"lat": lat, "lng": lng}
```

## API Keys/Secrets

- Many APIs require “keys” and “secrets”
	- (similar to a “username” and “password”)

### Why Do They Need API Keys?

-   The API provides access to confidential data or sensitive methods
    -   Only you should be able to send tweets from your Twitter account
-   The API costs money to use
    -   They need to know who to charge
-   They want to limit abuse
    -   Google Maps is free, but they want to keep you to from abusing it
    -  example: Denial of service attack: sending 1000 requests/min, overwhelms servers and leaks information.

### Where Do You Get API Keys?

- Typically: you register on their site.
- The process is different for every site.

### How Do You Use API Keys?

- & It varies by different APIs (on the API to tell you how to use it)
- For example, if this API needed a secret key sent with requests, they might expect as a URL parameter:
```python
requests.get("http://some-api.com/search",
    params={"key": "some-key",
            "isbn": "4675436632"})
```
- Or, they might need complex encoding — varies by API!
- Read the API docs!

## Keeping Your Secrets

- What’s the potential problem?

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask

API_SECRET_KEY = "this-is-secret"

app = Flask(__name__)

...
```
- You’ll want to store this file in Git — and probably GitHub
- You don’t want the world to learn your API key!
- !! Value of secret key should never-ever be committed to Github

- $ Solution Strategy:
	-   get the key from an _environmental variable_
	-   store those variables in a small, secret file
- Don’t check that file into Git!

### Example

- Install for securely storing secret keys
```shell
(venv) $ pip install python-dotenv
```

.env
```
API_SECRET_KEY=this-is-secret
```

app.py
```python nums {4}
import os
from flask import Flask

API_SECRET_KEY = os.environ['API_SECRET_KEY']

app = Flask(__name__)

# ... etc.
```
- From operating system, given os.environ ‘out of the box’, when using `.env` as filename
	- With flask, `flask run` will load environmental variables for you from your `.env` file
	- BUT if for some reason you are not running with flask, add this to app.py file:
	  ```python
	  from dotenv import load_dotenv
	  load_dotenv()
```

- & Add your `.env `to your .gitignore
```shell
$ echo .env > .gitignore
```

- & Make sure it _never_ gets into your Git!
```shell
$ git status
# Should NOT show up here at all

$ git add .

$ git status
# Should NOT show up here at all

$ git commit ...
```

## External APIs and Flask

### How External APIs Get Used in Flask

- Sometimes Flask gets JSON data and it *returns HTML*:
app.py
```python
@app.get("/book-info")
def show_book_info():
    """Return page about book."""

    isbn = request.args["isbn"]

    resp = requests.get("http://some-book-api.com/search",
        params={"isbn": isbn, "key": API_SECRET_KEY})

    book_data = resp.json()

    # using the APIs JSON data, render full HTML page
    return render_template("book_info.html", book=book_data)
```

- Sometimes Flask *gets JSON data*, *returns JSON data* to front end (= an API):
app.py
```python
@app.get("/book-data")
def show_book_info():
    """Return info about book."""

    isbn = request.args["isbn"]

    resp = requests.get("http://some-book-api.com/search",
        params={"isbn": isbn, "key": API_SECRET_KEY})

    book_data = resp.json()

    # using the APIs JSON data, return that to browser

    return jsonify(book_data)
```
- & Building/using your own API that sends external requests, gathers that data, and then returns that data to your front end is helpful particularly when you can’t make request info directly from browser because of Same-Origin-Policy or a need to increase security by keeping API keys out of browser.

## CORS

- The developers of an _API server_ can allow _cross-origin resource sharing_, as GitHub does, so their API can be used via AJAX.
- If you are building your own API and you want to *allow others* to use your API with AJAX: 
  →  enable CORS
-  Do this by enabling “CORS headers” sent as headers in the response.  
- To enable this in Flask, use [Flask-Cors](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Getting Around the Same Origin Policy

- You can’t!
- If server developers didn’t enable CORS, you can’t use their API via AJAX (only pages served from the same origin are allowed to)
- But: the SOP/CORS only applies to _AJAX calls_ not _any request_.
- So things like curl and Insomnia can reach their server, because those aren’t using AJAX—they’re just making a standard, non-AJAX request.
- AND, from your server-side code, you can get to the Twitter API, because server-side code is _not_ AJAX!

## API Libraries

- Some popular APIs have specialized libraries _(sometimes known as SDKs)_ written for a specific programming language that can help out.
- Big APis have libraries that you can download → Called *SDK*
- For example, there is a Python library for calling the Twitter API:
