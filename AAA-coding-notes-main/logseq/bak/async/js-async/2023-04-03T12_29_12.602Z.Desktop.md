## Goals

-   Examine callbacks in context of asynchronicity
-   Understand role of promises
-   Understand role of async / await
-   See common patterns and how to solve with async / await

## Callbacks

- A callback is a function passed to another function, for it to call.
- They are used for many things in JS.

### Functional Programming Patterns

- Useful for separating processing patterns from business logic.
```js
let paidInvoices = invoices.filter(
  inv => inv.owed <= 0
);
```

### Event-Driven Programming

- Register a function to be called when an event happens.
```js
$("#myForm").on("submit", sendDataToServer);
```

### Asynchronous Code

- Call those callbacks when asynchronous operation completes.
```js
setTimeout(callMeInASec, 1000);

ajaxLibrary.get("/page", callMeWhenResponseArrives);
```

- ~ Note: Some AJAX Libraries Use Callbacks
	- While axios doesn’t allow callbacks as a control-flow possibility for AJAX, other AJAX libraries, like jQuery, do.

- @ #rithmQ  The .get method shown, is this the jquery method? 
- @ #rithmQ Are there other libraries that are common to use this callback control flow with? (potentially that would have same/similar .get method)

### Callbacks Will Always Be Useful

- These cases will always be done with callbacks:
	-   Functional programming patterns
	-   Event-driven programming
- Let’s talk about third case, for handling asynchronicity

## Callbacks for Asynchronicity

### Why Not This?

```js
// pause for a second
stopHere(1000);
// now this code runs

// get via AJAX
var response = ajaxLibrary.get("/page");
// now we have response
```

- & JS is _single-threaded_, only one bit of code can run at once
-   If JS _actually_ stopped there, it couldn’t do other things like:
    -   Respond to events (clicks in browser, etc)
    -   Repaint DOM changes in browser
- By having a callback function for “once-async-thing-is-done”,  JS can finish running your code as quickly as possible.
- This way it can get to those other waiting tasks ASAP.

- ~ Note: Is JavaScript Single Threaded?
	- Largely, yes. JavaScript has “worker threads” that can do some background tasks, but these are limited in their scope. Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript cannot run multiple top-level threads.

### Callback Patterns

- Sequential callbacks can lead to hard-to-understand code:
```js
ajaxLib.get("/step-1", function f2(resp) {
  ajaxLib.get("/step-2", {resp.body}, function f3(resp) {
    ajaxLib.get("/step-3", {resp.body}, function done(resp) {
      console.log("got final answer", resp.body);
    });
  });
});
```

- This is often called “callback hell”

- You can flatten that by using non-anonymous functions:
```js
ajaxLib.get("/step-1", doStep2);

function doStep2(resp) {
  ajaxLib.get("/step-2", {resp.body}, doStep3);
}

function doStep3(resp) {
  ajaxLib.get("/step-3", {resp.body}, giveAnswer);
}

function giveAnswer(resp) {
  console.log("got final answer", resp.body);
}
```

- Each function needs to know what to do next;  this makes writing independent functions hard.
- It can be particularly hard to handle errors well for things like this.

## Promises

- Promises provide an alternate way to think about asynchronicity.
- & A promise is **one-time guarantee of future value**.

demo/pokemon.js
```js
const url = `${BASE_URL}/1`;
const p = axios({ url });
console.log("first", p);   // Promise {<pending>}
```

-   Promises in JavaScript are *objects*
-   They are native to the language as of ES2015
-   A promise can be in one of three states:
    -   _Pending_ - It doesn’t yet have a value
    -   _Resolved_ - It has successfully obtained a value
    -   _Rejected_ - It failed to obtain a value for some reason
-   The only way to access the resolved or rejected value is to *chain a method* on the end of the promise or *await it*

### .then and .catch

-   Promises provide a *.then* and a *.catch*, which both accept callbacks.
-   The callback to *.then* will run if the promise is resolved, and has access to the promise’s resolved value.
-   The callback to *.catch* will run if the promise is rejected,  and typically has access to some reason behind the rejection.

- ~ Note: **Thenables**
	- When reading about promises, you’ll often see a related term, called a **thenable**. A thenable is simply any object or function that has a then method defined on it.
	- By this definition, all promises are thenables, *but not all thenables are promises*! There are many more specifications that a promise needs to satisfy.
	- Here’s a simple example of a thenable that isn’t a promise:
	  ```js
	let notAPromise = {
	  fruit: "apple",
	  veggie: "carrot",
	  then: () => {
	    console.log("I'm just a random object with a then method.");
	  }
	};
	
	notAPromise.then();
	// "I'm just a random object with a then method."
	```


demo/pokemon.js
```js
const validUrl = `${BASE_URL}/1`;
const futureResolvedPromise = axios({ url: validUrl });

futureResolvedPromise
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.warn);
// keeps going ...
// ...
// ...

// NFW to get that answer

// promise to be rejected

const invalidUrl = `http://nope.nope`;
const futureRejectedPromise = axios.get(invalidUrl);

futureRejectedPromise
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.warn);


// promise chaining
axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/1` })
    .then(function f1(r1) {
      console.log(`#1: ${r1.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/2` });
    })
    .then(function f2(r2) {
      console.log(`#2: ${r2.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/3` });
    })
    .then(function f3(r3) {
      console.log(`#3: ${r3.data.name}`);
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.error(err);
```

demo/pokemon.js
```js
const invalidUrl = `http://nope.nope`;
const futureRejectedPromise = axios.get(invalidUrl);

futureRejectedPromise
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.warn);


// promise chaining
axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/1` })
    .then(function f1(r1) {
      console.log(`#1: ${r1.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/2` });
    })
    .then(function f2(r2) {
      console.log(`#2: ${r2.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/3` });
    })
    .then(function f3(r3) {
      console.log(`#3: ${r3.data.name}`);
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.error(err);
```

### Promise Chaining[

-   When calling .then on a promise, can return _new_ promise in callback!
    -   Can chain asynchronous operations together with *.then* calls
-   Only need _one_ .catch at the end—don’t have to catch every promise

demo/pokemon.js
```js
axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/1` })
    .then(function f1(r1) {
      console.log(`#1: ${r1.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/2` });
    })
    .then(function f2(r2) {
      console.log(`#2: ${r2.data.name}`);
      return axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/3` });
    })
    .then(function f3(r3) {
      console.log(`#3: ${r3.data.name}`);
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.error(err);
    });
```

### Benefits of Promises Over Callbacks

-   Easier to write good functions
    -   Each step doesn’t have be tied directly to next step
    -   With promises, .then method can just return value for next  
        without having to itself know what comes next
-   Error handling is much easier

## Async / Await

- async / await are language keywords for working with promises.

### async

-   You can declare any function in JavaScript as async
- &  async functions **always** return promises!
-   In async function, you write code that looks synchronous
    -   But it doesn’t block JavaScript

### await

-   Inside an async function, we can use await
-   await pauses execution
-   Can await any promise (eg other async functions!)
-   await waits for promise to resolve & evaluates to its resolved value
-   It then resumes execution
-   Think of the await keyword like a pause button

### Example

demo/pokemon.js
```js
async function getPokemonAwait() {
  const r1 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/1/` });
  // ...
  console.log(`#1: ${r1.data.name}`);

  const r2 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/2/` });
  console.log(`#2: ${r2.data.name}`);

  const r3 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/3/` });
  console.log(`#3: ${r3.data.name}`);
}
```

### Error Handling

demo/pokemon.js
```js
async function getPokemonAwaitCatch() {
  try {
    const r1 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/1/` });
    console.log(`#1: ${r1.data.name}`);

    const r2 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/2/` });
    console.log(`#2: ${r2.data.name}`);

    const r3 = await axios({ url: `${BASE_URL}/3/` });
    console.log(`#3: ${r3.data.name}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn("Try again later!");
  }
}
```

### Comparing .then/.catch and async/await

-   Under the hood, they do the same thing
-   async/await are the modern improvement
    -   Code can be written more naturally
-   There are a few cases where it’s easy to deal with promises directly

## Asynchronous Patterns

### Many Calls, Do Thing On Return & Don’t Block

- Need to make several AJAX calls and do things _as they return_:
![](../assets/image/js-async-1680523876877.jpeg)


### Many Calls, in Sequence

- Need to make AJAX calls one-at-a-time, in order:
![](../assets/image/js-async-1680523969404.jpeg)

-   *Promise.all* accepts an array of promises and returns a _new_ promise
-   New promise will resolve when every promise in array resolves,  
    and will be rejected if any promise in array is rejected
-   *Promise.allSettled* accepts an array of promises and returns a _new_ promise
-   The promise resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise.

### Promise.allSettled

```js
const GITHUB_BASE_URL = 'https://api.github.com';

let elieP = axios({url:`${GITHUB_BASE_URL}/users/elie`});

let joelP = axios({url:`${GITHUB_BASE_URL}/users/joelburton`});

let doesNotExistP = axios({url:`${GITHUB_BASE_URL}/user/dsdsdsds`});

let results = await Promise.allSettled([elieP, joelP, doesNotExistP]);

console.log(results);

/*
  {status: 'fulfilled', value: {…}}
  {status: 'fulfilled', value: {…}}
  {status: 'rejected', reason: Request failed with status code 404...}
*/
```

- ~ Tip: Promise.all - many calls, in any order, fails fast
	- Make several calls, but they don’t depend on each other. If one fails, the whole thing fails
```js
	let p1 = axios({ url: '/1' });
	let p2 = axios({ url: '/2' });
	let p3 = axios({ url: '/3' });
	
	let resultsPromise = await Promise.all(
	    [p1, p2, p3]);
```

### Many Calls, First One Wins

- Can get answer from any call; stop after any responds:
![](../assets/image/js-async-1680524464232.jpeg)

-   Promise.race accepts an array of promises and returns a _new_ promise
-   This new promise will resolve or reject as soon as _one_ promise in the array resolves or rejects

## Advanced: Building Own Promises

-   You can use Promise with the *new* keyword to make your own promises
-   Unfortunately, the syntax here takes some getting used to
-   Promise accepts a single function (call it _fn_) as an argument
    -   fn accepts two functions as arguments, resolve and reject
    -   Pass resolve a value for the promise to resolve to that value
    -   Pass reject a value for the promise to reject to that value

### Example: setTimeout as a Promise

- Asnyc callbacks can be rewritten as promises:

demo/promiseTimeout.js
```js
function wait(msec) {
  let p = new Promise(
      function (resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(function () {
          // cause promise to resolve: any await-er will resume
          resolve();

          // we have no error conditions -- if we did, we
          // would call reject() to reject this
        }, msec);
      }
  );
  return p;
}

async function demo() {
  console.log("hi");
  await wait(1000);
  console.log("there");
}
```

## Wrap Up

-   Callbacks will always be useful!
    -   But they’re not the best way to handle asynchronicity
-   Promises improve things
    -   But they’re much easier with async / await for most things
-   Prefer using async / await over promises
    -   Watch out for stuff like:
        ```js
        var resp = await axios({ url: "/1" })
            .then(resp => console.log());
        ```
    -   What is this awaiting?! What is resp?!
        - resp will be the result of _await_ for *the entire line*–
            - the axios call is resolved by the arrow function, which does console log the error, but returns a promise of undefined— 
                - which is then awaited and becomes the resolution of undefined– which is assigned to resp.

Phew.

In other words: don’t mix await and .then. It almost certainly isn’t useful. Just await things.
