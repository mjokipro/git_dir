React Routers:
Two scenarios to handle redirects:
-1. You completed what you were supposed to do on this page, gets added to browser history, can click the back button, useNavigate component
-2. You weren’t supposed to get here, “404” scenario, does not add to browser history, Navigate html method(?) to redirect user

- with React 
- <router>
	- routes run in the order they are coded
	- like if statements
		- if
		- else if
		- else if
		- etc.
		- else
	- make sure to thoughtfully place them in order and don’t have your “catch all” case before your more specific cases
