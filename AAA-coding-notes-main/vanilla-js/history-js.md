- The most recent ECMAScript version is ES13 and was introduced in June 2022.The more important thing to remember, the most significant update was ES6 in June 2015 which introduced `let` , `const` , `arrow functions`, `promises` , `template literals`, `class declarations`, and stupid `for…of` loops to name a few things.
  Random fact: it is also known as “ECMAScript Harmony” or “ES6 Harmony”
