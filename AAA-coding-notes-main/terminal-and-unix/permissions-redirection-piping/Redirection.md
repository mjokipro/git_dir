- >  Single arrow will overwrite whatever is in the file on the right hand side with the text/info on the left hand side.
- >> Double arrow will append the text/info from the left hand side to the end of the file on the right hand side

	- sort < names.txt > sorted.txt
	- Will sort names in names.txt, then save them into a new file, sorted.txt
