- What is a shell? Bash/ZSH
	- Shell is a program that actually processes commands and returns output. Manages foreground and background processees, command history and command line editing.
	- Terminal is a wrapper program that runs a shell. (used to be physical device of just monitor and keyboard, now abstracted in software)
	- Common examples of a shell are bash and ZSH
- How is Terminal Structured?
	- In terminal, all files & folders start in the root directory. root directory is noted by /
	- Root directory has many important files and programs for computer, hence don't want to modify these files & folders often
	- Instead we usually modify files & folders of our home directory, which is our own user folder within a Users folder in the root directory. Home directory is noted by ~
	- ~ is same thing as saying /Users/alyssa  (assuming my username is alyssa)
- How do you move around your files & folders
	- cd is change directory, and is the command use to navigate directories/folders
	- type cd followed by the directory or path name you want to navigate to
	- to move up a directory, type cd ..
- Absolute vs Relative paths
	- A path is simply a way to reach a file or folder
	- Absolute path states the path starting from the root directory
	- Relative path states the path starting from where you are at now
	- For example, if in the home directory and I want to navigate to Desktop can do so in 2 ways:
		- Absolute path: cd /Users/alyssa/Desktop  
		- Relative path: cd Desktop
