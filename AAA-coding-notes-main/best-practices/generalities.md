- Making your program <u>clearer</u> is always the goal
- Generally don’t want the same ‘fact’ in 2 places
	- But, don’t make a global variable if the value is going to change throughout the code, better to pass this explicitly to the functions that need it
- Assume tests are accurate
	- If you think you found a bug in a test, call in a team lead to discuss
		- DON’T JUST CHANGE A TEST
- Arrow vs Declaration:
	- Arrow functions are good for short sweet callbacks
	- Real functions deserve real function declarations. If longer, use a fx declaration and pass it’s variable name into the higher order function
	- Event listeners should have a real named function, not anonymous callback
- A function should not return 2 different types of data
	- Return only strings, or numbers, etc.
	- Throw an error in the cases where you’d otherwise want to return another data type like “Invalid input type”
- #tip Separate parameters on their own lines when you need to break them up b/c of line lengths
