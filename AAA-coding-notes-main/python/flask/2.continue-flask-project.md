## Short Form
1. `python3 -m venv venv`
2. `source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `git status`
5. `flask run`

## Long Form
1. Pull latest code 
2. Ensure you are in project folder in Terminal window
3. Create your own virtual environment
	1. `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Start using your venv
	1. `source venv/bin/activate`
	2. Your Terminal command line should now start with `(venv)`
6. Install in your `venv` all items from `requirements.txt`
	1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
7. Check `git status`  and ensure that items in your`venv` folder are ignored 
8. Run `flask run` and you’re good to go!


## Troubleshooting with Flask
- `which flask` will tell you where you are running flask from
- Remember that the `venv` folder and the `app.py` need to be at the same level
- Risky to install flask globally b/c 
	- app1 needs flask 1.1
	- app2 needs flask 2.4
	- etc. which is difficult to do and keep track of globally
-  Running Flask on some Macs
	- If you get an error that your address is already in use after starting up flask with `flask run`, you may need to run on port 5001 instead. Some Macs running newer software already have a process running on port 5000 by default, so the port is already taken.
	- To run flask on port 5001, run `flask run -p 5001` from the command line.
	- If you’re curious and would like to see what processes are listening on port 5000 at any given time, the command `lsof -i :5000` will give you that info!
