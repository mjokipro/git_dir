## Flask Debugging

Strategies:
-   as always print() _(appears in terminal)_
-   Flask Debug Toolbar
-   Get an error? You can debug on the error page!

### Debugging Errors

1. Click the black “Terminal” symbol in a traceback
2. You’ll need to enter “PIN code” 
	1. & Look for PIN code that is printed out to terminal at start of flask
3. That will give you a Python interpreter right there!
4. You can examine variables, try out code, etc.
	1.  Right there in the browser!
