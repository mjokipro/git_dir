- #tip Joel -  Don’t mix mutating with rebinding.
	- If you’re mutating an array, mutate it throughout the program
	- If you’re rebinding, rebind throughout
	- Otherwise you end up with *really* difficult bugs.

#tip Joel - Pretend like your projects are a part of a bigger program to prompt smart design

#tip Joel - can be helpful sometimes to throw error your self to debug - esp. with express that doesn’t have nice error msgs

- express doesn’t come with sessions -  it’s a bit smaller than flask, so there isn’t built in things like flash. but there are built in libraries that can implement this
