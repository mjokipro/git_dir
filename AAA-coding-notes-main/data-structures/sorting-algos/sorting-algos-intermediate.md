## Why these are important

- Beginner ones donâ€™t scale well
- These algos improve time complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(nlogn)`
- Tradeoff from efficiency and simplicity

## Types Intermediate sorting

- [merge-sort](merge-sort.md)
- [quick-sort](quick-sort.md)
- [radix-sort](radix-sort.md)


## Comparison Sorts

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- [merge-sort](merge-sort.md)
- [quick-sort](quick-sort.md)

- & Best average time complexity (lower bound): `O(nlogn)`
