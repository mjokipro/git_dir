- managing function invocations
	- call stack
- undo/redo
- routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
	- like in React
- used as intermediate in other algorithms
	- to store data while traversing graph or tree, to remember the way back up

- Insertion O(1)
- Removal O(1)
- Searching O(n)
- Access O(n)
