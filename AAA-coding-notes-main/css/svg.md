A useful property of an _SVG_ (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a `path` attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.
-svg icons are better than font-icons: screen readers try to read out font-icons and fail to do so. Best practice to move away from icon fonts and instead use SVGs.
