### RGB Color model
There are two main color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices, and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.

with the RGB model, colors begin as black, and change as different levels of red, green, and blue are introduced. An easy way to see this is with the CSS `rgb` function.

```css
rgb(red, green, blue);
```

Each red, green, and blue value is a number from `0` to `255`. `0` means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. `255` means that there's 100% of that color.

#### Secondary Colors
Secondary colors are the colors you get when you combine primary colors. You might have noticed some secondary colors in the last step as you changed the red, green, and blue values.

#### Tertiary Colors
Now that you're familiar with secondary colors, you'll learn how to create tertiary colors. Tertiary colors are created by combining a primary with a nearby secondary color.

Notice that, to create orange, you had to increase the intensity of red and decrease the intensity of the green `rgb` values. This is because orange is the combination of red and yellow, and falls between the two colors on the color wheel.
Spring green: combine cyan with green. Update the `rgb` function in the `.two` CSS rule so that green is at the max value, and set blue to `127`.
There are three more tertiary colors: chartreuse green (green + yellow), azure (blue + cyan), and rose (red + magenta).

Now that you've gone through all the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors on a color wheel, it'll be easier to understand other color theory concepts and how they impact design.

#### Color Wheel
A color wheel is a circle where similar colors, or hues, are near each other, and different ones are further apart. For example, pure red is between the hues rose and orange.

Two colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel are called complementary colors. If two complementary colors are combined, they produce gray. But when they are placed side-by-side, these colors produce strong visual contrast and appear brighter

Notice that the red and cyan colors are very bright right next to each other. This contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background.

It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.

Notice how your eyes are naturally drawn to the red color in the center? When designing a site, you can use this effect to draw attention to important headings, buttons, or links.

### Hex Values with Color
A very common way to apply color to an element with CSS is with hexadecimal or hex values. While hex values sound complicated, they're really just another form of RGB values.

Hex color values start with a `#` character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, `#4B5320`.

You may already be familiar with decimal, or base 10 values, which go from 0 - 9. Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F:

```js
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
```

With hex colors, `00` is 0% of that color, and `FF` is 100%. So `#00FF00` translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as `rgb(0, 255, 0)`.

### HSL Color Model
The HSL color model, or hue, saturation, and lightness, is another way to represent colors.

The CSS `hsl` function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.

If you imagine a color wheel, the hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.

Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.

Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
```js
.blue {
	background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);
}
```

### Gradients
You've learned a few ways to set flat colors in CSS, but you can also use a color transition, or gradient, on an element.

A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS `linear-gradient` function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the `linear-gradient` function actually creates an `image` element, and is usually paired with the `background` property which can accept an image as a value.

The `linear-gradient` function is very flexible -- here is the basic syntax you'll use in this tutorial:

```css
linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
```

`gradientDirection` is the direction of the line used for the transition. `color1` and `color2` are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, `rgb`, or `hsl`.

 While the `linear-gradient` function needs a minimum of two color arguments to work, it can accept many color arguments.

Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like `px` or percentages that follow a color in the `linear-gradient` function.

For example, in this red-black gradient, the transition from red to black takes place at the 90% point along the gradient line, so red takes up most of the available space:

```css
linear-gradient(90deg, red 90%, black);
```

(also modified direction to be 180 deg )
Now that the color-stops are set, you'll apply different shades of red to each color argument in the `linear-gradient` function. The shades on the top and bottom edges of the marker will be darker, while the one in the middle will be lighter, as if there's a light above it.

```css
.red {
	background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgb(122, 74, 14) 0%, rgb(245, 62, 113) 50%, rgb(162, 27, 27) 100%);
}
```

```css
.green {
	background: linear-gradient(180deg, #55680D, #71F53E, #116C31);
}
```
Even without the color-stops, you might have noticed that the colors for the green marker transition at the same points as the red marker. The first color is at the start (0%), the second is in the middle (50%), and the last is at the end (100%) of the gradient line.

The `linear-gradient` function automatically calculates these values for you, and places colors evenly along the gradient line by default.

If no `gradientDirection` argument is provided to the `linear-gradient` function, it arranges colors from top to bottom, or along a 180 degree line, by default.

Example using hsl colors:
```css
.blue {
	background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(223, 90%, 60%), hsl(240, 56%, 42%));
}
```

### Opacity
Opacity describes how opaque, or non-transparent, something is. For example, a solid wall is opaque, and no light can pass through. But a drinking glass is much more transparent, and you can see through the glass to the other side.

With the CSS `opacity` property, you can control how opaque or transparent an element is. With the value `0`, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at `1.0`, or 100%, the element will be completely opaque like it is by default.

```css
.sleeve {
	width: 110px;
	height: 25px;
	background-color: white;
	opacity: 0.5;
}
```
Another way to set the opacity for an element is with the alpha channel. Similar to the `opacity` property, the alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is.

You're already familiar with using the `rgb` function to set colors. To add an alpha channel to an `rgb` color, use the `rgba` function instead.

The `rgba` function works just like the `rgb` function, but takes one more number from `0` to `1.0` for the alpha channel:

```css
rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);
```

```css
.sleeve {
	width: 110px;
	height: 25px;
	background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 50%);
}
```
