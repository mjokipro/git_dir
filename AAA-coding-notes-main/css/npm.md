- For new project
	- Check that you are in your project folder

`npm init`
to create package.json file

- install node sass
`npm install node-sass --save-dev`
(—save-dev b/c it’s a development tool)

- package.json allows you to share this file without sharing all of the many dependencies package files
- With just package.json and project files, can reinstall depencies with just:
`npm install`

- To uninstall
`npm uninstall jquery --save`
cause jquery is a regular dependency vs dev dependency
