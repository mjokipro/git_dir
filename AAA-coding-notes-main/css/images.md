## Responsive Images
- Want images to be responsive, so should always define image width and height in %
- image should be block or inline-block to get rid of the whitespace

## `object-fit`
- Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, you can use the `object-fit` property to determine how images should behave.
```css
.selector {
	object-fit: cover;
}
```
