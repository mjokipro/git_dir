### RESEARCH

Take time to look into whoever you are writing to (use LinkedIn / Google) to make sure you are asking the right person and ask yourself: 

- How long have they been at this company?
- What can you see about their career/passions?
- Have they written a blog post you could refer to?
- Anything interesting/unique about them?
- Any shared interests, skills, or background (location, alma mater)?
- Any new news on the company you could reference?
- Note anything else that feels relevant/professional.

### STRUCTURE

- The structure of a LinkedIn message:
	- Greeting
	- Acknowledge human / engage them with a question
	- Share why you are reaching out
	- Offer value
	- Ask for call
	- Sign off

- Be mindful of not using “I” too much.  Make this about the person you are writing to.  
- Add value.  
- YOU ARE VALUABLE! Come from that place as you write.
