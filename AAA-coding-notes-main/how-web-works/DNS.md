## ISPs
- Internet Service Provider
- Can do bad things like:
	- remember a site IP address for 3 weeks
	- if nothing found, instead of throwing an error, gives advertisement to buy site
	- They don’t want you to host your site on their service to your home, so they change your IP address every few days to force you to buy space on a server.
