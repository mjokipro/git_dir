- Reviews are listening, not changing code. Hands off the keyboard, please.
- Reviews are for _both of you_, not just the current driver.

-   **Always** commit before asking for a code review.
-   Sometimes you’ll be ready for a review, but instructors will be busy.
    -   Keep working!
    -   When we’re ready, `git stash` to stash your changes since the commit.
    -   After review, `git stash pop` to unstash your changes.
