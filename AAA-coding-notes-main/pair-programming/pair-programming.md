- Switch roles every 20 mins

## Driver
- **Writes code**
-  **Explaining plan.** Don’t leave partner in the dark!
	- As the driver, it’s your job to talk your partner through each step when you code and make sure that your partner remains engaged.
	- If you’re unsure, ask them to paraphrase what is happening to ensure they do understand
-  **Asking for help.** Navigator is there to help you find solutions.


## Navigator
- **Reviews code**
	- Ensure you are following instructions
	- Not going down rabbit holes
- **Asking clarifying questions.** 
	- Make sure both of you know the plan.
- **Does side-research for debugging** 
	- Minimize amount of context switching driver has to do. When you need research, the navigator should be the one to head to Google.
- **Remembering big picture.** 
	- Driver may lose the forest for the trees while writing code; make sure you keep team on track.


## Getting stuck
-   If you have a bug, saying “my code doesn’t work” is unacceptable
    -   What assumptions have you made about the bug?
    -   What have you tested?
    -   Where is the bug happening?
-   If you have a question, make sure you first do your research
    -   What exactly are you looking for?
    -   What have you searched for?
