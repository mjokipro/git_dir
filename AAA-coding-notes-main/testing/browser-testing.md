## Testing individual functions 

When you open `emojiRace.html`, the `emojiRace.js` file will also be loaded. This means that you can access any of the functions, variables, and classes in your javascript file _directly in the console_!

-   Open `emoji.html` in your browser.
-   Open the Chrome Dev Tools (they should always be open!)
-   Write Javascript in the console! Hereâ€™s how you can set up a race before you have a working start button:
    handleStartBtn()
-   Hereâ€™s how you can test out the individual methods in your classes as you write them:
    const c1 = new Contestant("![ðŸŽƒ]", c1HtmlLocation, c1HtmlStepDisplay);
    c1.move()
