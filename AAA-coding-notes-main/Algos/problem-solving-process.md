- & Important to practice this process because it allows you to solve harder problems.

## The process
1.  Understand the Problem
2.  Explore Concrete Examples
3.  Break It Down
4.  Solve a Simpler Problem
5.  Use Tools Strategically
6.  Look Back and Refactor

### 1. Understand the problem
*Hold the problem in your head, reduce context switching, let the right half of your brain do the work*
-   Can I restate the problem in my own words?  
-   What are the inputs that go into the problem?
-   What are outputs that are required by the problem?
-   Do I have enough information?  <u>Exactly</u> what is the output
-   How should I <u>name</u> the important data in this problem?  Distill down exactly what the data is.

### 2. Explore concrete examples
*Abstract the code away, make it real world, try DRAWING the problem. For already existing code, can draw a call graph*
-   Start with simple examples
-   Progress to more complex examples
-   Explore examples with empty inputs
-   Explore examples with invalid inputs

### 3. Break it down

-   Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
-   You can write or draw this as pseudocode
-   This forces you to think about the solution rather than the syntax
-   This helps you catch any lingering misunderstandings
-   Don’t write code!

### 4. Solve a simpler problem
*strengthen your belief that you can do all the other steps, work on the “easier” parts can lead you to figuring out the harder parts*

-   Find the core difficulty in what you’re trying to do
-   Temporarily ignore that difficulty
-   Write a simplified solution
-   Then incorporate that difficulty back in

- % Note: this is easier said than done
	- If you simplify too much, you may make the problem too simple, in which case solving the simpler problem provides little insight into the original.
	- But if you don’t simplify enough, you still might be stuck on a problem that is too challenging. Finding the right sub-problem to isolate takes a decent amount of practice.

### 5. Use tools strategically
*what do you suspect? what can you prove?*
-   Use your debugging tools. (Practice with problems that are already solved to get comfy w/debugger)
-   Don’t guess and check!
-   Scientific approach: make hypotheses, test, draw conclusions. Repeat.

### 6. Look back and refactor

-   Does the result match your expected output?
-   Can you improve the clarity of your solution?
-   What other ideas could you have pursued?

The only way to get better is to practice using this plan!
