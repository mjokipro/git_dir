Goal: to Abstract away from machine code/1s and 0s to be more efficient and effective

Lowest to Highest level languages:
Machine code: Binary code
Short Code/Short Order Code: One of the first low-level languages. Example: Assembly language (Assembler) - still used today

Beginning Human readable languages:
- FORTRAN (FORUMula TRANslator) 1954 by John Backus, IBM
- Lisp in 1958
- COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) in 1960
- BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) in 1964
