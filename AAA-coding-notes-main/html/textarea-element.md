The `textarea` element acts like an `input` element of type `text`, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns.

Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a `label` with the text `Provide a bio:` at the end of the `fieldset`. Add a `textarea` element inside the `label` element. Note that the `textarea` requires a closing tag.

The `textarea` appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the `rows` and `cols` attributes.
