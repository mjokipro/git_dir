# Broken App Issues
# Code is sloppy, no error handlers, variable names are irrelevant
# Changed variable names for easier readability, added the catched error in the try/catch
# removed any "VAR" declarations to avoid scope issues
# added json and urlencoded
# converted the calls to axios into a Promise.all, since each call itself is a promise, and they do not get resolved by simply being called into an array
