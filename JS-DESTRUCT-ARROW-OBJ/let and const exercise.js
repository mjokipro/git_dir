// 1.  const PI = 42;
// 2.  var can be hoisted, is function scoped, global scoped, can
//     be re-initialized, and re-declared.

//     let isn't hoisted, function scoped, block scoped, can be 
//     re-initialized, and cannot be re-declared.

//     const is same as let, except it cannot be re-init nor re-declared.
