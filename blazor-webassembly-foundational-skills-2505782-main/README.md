Looking to boost your skills for a new project or more advanced role? Check out Blazor WebAssembly, the Microsoft framework that lets you build your own apps using C# and .NET—without writing a single line of JavaScript. Join instructor and senior web developer David Grace in this intermediate-level course, as he gives you an overview of how to configure and deploy web applications with Blazor WebAssembly.

Explore the process of implementing CSS to particular Razor components, using both templates and customized components to meet the unique needs of your online environment. David covers configuration settings, API integration, HttpClient setup, cross-origin resource sharing, authentication, and more, as well as how to log and handle errors before and after you officially publish your application. By the end of this course, you’ll be ready to deploy a Blazor WebAssembly application using Microsoft Visual Studio, the .NET command line, Windows IIS, and Google.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
